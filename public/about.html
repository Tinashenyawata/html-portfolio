<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an aspiring Web Developer. I have crazily-interesting ideas of things I want to build and want to use everything I learn in
   making them come to reality and effecting some positive change. </p>

<p>I accept any views and comments, so long as they are positive and construtive. If we can work and collaborate together
  that will be most appreciated.
</p>

<p>And of course, this is just the beggining. More to come for sure!</p>
